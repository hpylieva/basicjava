# basicjava
This repo contains the accomplishments of assignments for the first task of Advanced Programming course MS@CS UCU.<br>
To review small programs in work go to src/main/java and run Main.java. This will show you an Optioin Dialog about which part of Hometask to run.<br><br>
NeverUseSwitch is implemented through enum. Could ou give some comments about this method? To me it seems rather elegent.
Ive also used it in CharacterFactory class for HeroesGame.<br>
In HeroesGame I've implemented Class Knight as "extends King" not to copy and paste method fight(Character c).<br>
All the rest of parts do not need comments from my point of view.<br>
